### React Hooks

Some functional features have been added to this project using React hooks:

#### useState Hook

The useState hook is used to manage state within the component. For example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const jsonData = await response.json();
    setData(jsonData);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

```
