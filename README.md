# Appointment 

Project Description: (Medical Care is a modern web application designed to simplify the appointment booking process in healthcare facilities. Built using React, it offers a seamless user experience for patients to search for doctors, schedule appointments, and manage their bookings. The application also includes features for doctors to view their appointment schedules and mark appointments as consulted.
)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- React
- React Bootstrap
- Other libraries used...


## Usage

Once the application is started, you can see the doctors on the main page under the "Our Doctors" section. Clicking on any doctor will open a modal window to make an appointment. You can fill in the necessary information in the modal window to create your appointment. Additionally, you can view your existing appointments in the "Appointments" section and cancel any appointment you want.

### React Hooks

Some functional features have been added to this project using React hooks:

#### useState Hook

The useState hook is used to manage state within the component. For example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const jsonData = await response.json();
    setData(jsonData);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

```
